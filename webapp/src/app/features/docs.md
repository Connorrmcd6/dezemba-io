Feature modules house the main features of your Angular application.

If you’re building an ecommerce application, for example, you might have specific sets of functionalities, such as orders, products, cart, customers, etc. Breaking these functionalities into feature modules helps you split the application into dedicated areas. This enables multiple developers or teams of developers to work on independent features without breaking other parts of the application.
